# How to unfollow everyone on Twitter
You might wonder, "why did he write this programme?" 
Well the first reason I wrote this programme is just for fun and call to my mind how JS works because I haven't coded on it for a year //perhaps more, I don't remember

But actually, sometimes you need to start everything with a clear list. So the first thing that you can do - clear your Twitter Feed //just unfollow everyone =), that's what I did 
And I guess a lot of you have more than 100 pages following, so my programme can make it easier for you

Here are steps that you need to follow =)

Step 1: sign in to your Twitter account

Step 2: Click on following

Step 3: Scroll down the page until the last follower appears

Step 4: Open development console // chrome: ctrl+shift+J (Windows / Linux or Cmd + Opt + J on Mac), Option + âŒ˜ + C (Safari)

Step 5: Copy and paste the following code in the console and click Enter

Have Fun =)
